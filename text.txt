Q1) Write a class program to find out live racer in F1 arena.Use appropriate class data member. Follow the OOPS data hiding technique.

Q2)wap a car class having attributes like
string make;
    string model;
    string color;
    int year;
    bool isEngineOn;
initialize all attributes using constructor only.
function are
start() 
stop()
displayDetails()

in start() and stop() function check status of engine after that take decision or action on start and stop function.Choose method and constructor as per need either default or parameterized.
Also make sure you have to implement all using encapsulation concept.

q3) Imagine a tollbooth at a bridge. Cars passing by the booth are expected to pay a 50 cent
toll. Mostly they do, but sometimes a car goes by without paying. The tollbooth keeps
track of the number of cars that have gone by, and of the total amount of money collected. 
Model this tollbooth with a class called tollBooth. The two data items are a type
unsigned int to hold the total number of cars, and a type double to hold the total amount
of money collected. A constructor initializes both of these to 0. A member function called
payingCar() increments the car total and adds 0.50 to the cash total. Another function,
called nopayCar(), increments the car total but adds nothing to the cash total. Finally, a
member function called display() displays the two totals. Make appropriate member
functions const.the program to print out the total cars and total cash, and total paying and non paying car.
